\title{Predict the momentum using a cross-validated regularized pocket algorithm}
\usage{
predict_momentum_reg_pocket_cv(
  prices,
  time_window,
  price_means,
  weight_elimination,
  trading_period_probs,
  nfolds,
  maxit_per_fold,
  num_train
)
}
\arguments{
\item{price_means}{the historic mean of the prices (exponentially
weighted average of past prices)}

\item{weight_elimination}{A list of weight elimination constants
to use during the nested cross-validation.}

\item{trading_period_probs}{The relative probability of each trading period,
used for sampling and error evaluation}

\item{nfolds}{the number of folds to cross-validate on at each
time-step}

\item{maxit_per_fold}{maximum number of iterations in the pocket
algorithm per fold}

\item{num_train}{The number of trading periods to train on
before predicting anything.}
}
\value{
the predicted momentum as a vector
}
\description{
Cross validates over the first
num_train parameters from the given weight elimination parameters
and weight decay parameters over time. Then predicts
the remaining momenta.
