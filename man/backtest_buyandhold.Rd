\usage{
backtest_buyandhold(price_relatives, transaction_rate, initial_portfolio)
}
\arguments{
\item{price_relatives}{a matrix of price relatives, each row
representing a trading period and each column an asset.
A price relative is \eqn{\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}}}, i.e.
the ratio of previous price to new price. Prices change
according to the price relatives after the trade,
i.e. the price relatives for the trading period are not known
at trading time}

\item{transaction_rate}{The percentage of each transaction (buy and sell)
spent on broker fees}

\item{initial_portfolio}{a vector whose \eqn{i}th entry is the
    amount of wealth in the \eqn{i}th entry. Should
    be a portfolio for the assets in \code{price_relatives}.
    This is the portfolio before the first trading period.

 @return a matrix with the same number of columns as
     \code{price_relatives} but one more row, row \eqn{i}
     is the portfolio before trading begins during period \eqn{i}.}
